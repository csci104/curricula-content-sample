This one's pretty simple.
Write a program that outputs `Hello, world!` plus a newline.
The catch is that **you may not use single or double quotes** in the entire program.
Don't worry; it's not as difficult as it sounds!

## Specifications

Your solution should be written in the file `hello/hello.cpp` relative to the root of your submission directory.
It should include a valid main, as we will compile it alone with `g++` to test it.
